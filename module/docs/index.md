``contact``: Accessing contacts
===============================

The ``forge.contact`` namespace allows access to the native contact
address book on the device the app is running on.

Contacts are represented by a simple JavaScript object which follows the [W3C Contacts API](http://www.w3.org/TR/contacts-api/#contact-interface>) as much as possible.

##API

!method: forge.contact.select(success, error)
!param: success `function(contact)` callback to be invoked when no errors occur
!description: Prompts the user to select a contact and returns a contact object.
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

!method: forge.contact.selectAll([fields, ]success, error)
!param: fields `[string]` array of additional fields to include with each contact id and name.
!param: success `function(contactList)` callback to be invoked when no errors occur
!description: Returns a list of all the available contact IDs and contact names.
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

> ::Note:: Due to performance limitations on Android devices, ``selectAll`` is unable to return the full list of fully populated contact names; our recommended pattern is to use this method to get the list of all available contact IDs, then lazily load the more detailed full contact information with the ``selectById`` method.

!method: forge.contact.selectById(id, success, error)
!param: id `string` contact ID to be queried
!param: success `function(contact)` callback to be invoked when no errors occur
!description: Returns more detailed information about a contact whose contact ID we already know.
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

!method: forge.contact.add(contact, success, error)
!param: contact `object` Contact object to add. See Supported fields are: `name`, `nickname`, `phoneNumbers`, `emails`, `addresses`, `note`. See "Contact object" documentation below for the object format.
!param: success `function(contact)` callback to be invoked when no errors occur
!description: Adds a contact via the "Add Contact" dialog. Returns the contact id if it was successfully added
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

!method: forge.contact.insert(contact, success, error)
!param: contact `object` Contact object to add. Supported fields are: `name`, `nickname`, `phoneNumbers`, `emails`, `addresses`, `note`. See "Contact object" documentation below for the object format. 
!param: success `function(contact)` callback to be invoked when no errors occur
!description: Inserts a contact without requiring user intervention. Returns the contact id if it was successfully added.
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur


##Contact object 

When using ``selectAll``, the returned contacts list would look
something like:

    [
        {
            "id": "14894",
            "displayName": "Mr Joe Bloggs"
        },
        {
            "id": "481516",
            "displayName": "Mr John Locke"
        },
        ...
    ]

Below is an example of a contact object returned from ``select`` or
``selectById``, with details for some field types.
